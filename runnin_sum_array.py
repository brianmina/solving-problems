# Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
#
# Return the running sum of nums.
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [1,3,6,10]
# Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
# -10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
